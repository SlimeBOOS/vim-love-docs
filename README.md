Vim LOVE Docs
###

Put the [`gen`](gen) directory inside `vimfiles\after` then run [`gen.bat`](gen/gen.bat) or [`gen.sh`](gen/gen.sh).

The file included should work fine until the next update of LOVE.

The bat and sh files assume you have `love` mapped to the most recent version of LOVE. If you're on Windows, add the directory path to LOVE to the `path` environment variable. If you're on Linux, you should know how to do that.
