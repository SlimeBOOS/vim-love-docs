Vim LOVE Docs
===

Vim syntax highlighting and helpfile for [LÖVE](http://love2d.org). 

Installing
---

- Pathogen: Put in `vimfiles/bundles`
- Vundle: Should work (untested)
- Other: Put the folders (other than [src](src)) into their corresponding directories in `vimfiles`. 


The file included should work fine until the next update of LOVE.

Running
---

In order to generate the files, navigate to the [src](src) directory to choose which form to generate and run The `.bat` or `.sh` file depending on the machine you're running. These assume you have the following mappings:

- `git`: Mapped to Git client.
- `love`: Mapped to the LÖVE executable.
- `vim`: Mapped to `vim.exe` (or `gvim.exe`).
